for sequential we can only map one input to one output. Convinient, but not flexible
for functional we can handle multiple inputs and outputs. more flexible

Sigmoid is used for binary classification,
while SoftMax applies to multiclass problems

if labels are one hot encoded, use categorical_crossentropy
if its not, and y is just a label 8 for example, use sparse categorical cross entropy

batch normalizer normalizers the data so trianing is faster, but it also has a regularization effect of
